# What can GraphQL do for app developers

---

## Who am I

---

<h3>Sa≈°a Pul</h3>

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>fullstack dev @Freska</li>
    <li>not an IOS, or mac developer</li>
    <li>startred using GraphQL roughly 6 months ago</li>
    <li>my first public talk</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>


```notes
- fullstack means I do JS, and it spans both FE and BE
- did a react native app with a few Objective-c classes
- NOT a gql expert, just think it's awesome and love to talk about it
- first talk - go easy on me :) 
-

## What is GraphQL?

```notes
- who has heard of it
- who has used it?
- used it as a consumer or created an API
```
---

<h3>Strongly typed query language for your API</h3>

<Appear>
    <h3>And a server-side runtime for executing queries...</h3>
    <h3>...by using a type system you define for your data.</h3>
</Appear>

```notes
- strongly typed: if type validation fails, request fails
```
---

<h3>More efficient alternative to REST</h3>

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Created (2012.) and opensourced by Facebook (2015.)</li>
    <li>Enables declarative data fetching</li>
    <li>Exposes a single endpoint</li>
    <li>Not limited to frontend/react</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- first used for FB native mobile app
- spec, and graphqlJS by FB
- announced by FB on react conf, so there was a confusion about it and it was not often mentioned in context of mobile apps 
```
---

<h3>Implementations</h3>

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Client</li>
    <ul><li>C#, Clojurescript, Go, Java (Android), JavaScript, <strong>Swift/Objective-C</strong>, Python...</li></ul>
    <li>Server</li>
    <ul><li>C#, Clojure, Elixir, Erlang, Go, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Scala, Ruby...</li></ul>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages over REST</h3>
<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>more efficient data fetching</li>
    <li>no need for versioning</li>
    <li>composing APIs</li>
    <li>powerful analytics</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- versioning:
  - no need to adjust API with every product requirement or design change
  - if new data is needed, simply add it to the schema, and those who need it will use it
- composing: use several different resources, or even combine multiple graphql APIs
  - exapmle: use your backend API alongside contentful (or whatever CMS) API
- analytics:
  - able to track what data is requested by clients
  - evolve and deprecate
```
---
export default Split

<Img src={require("file-loader!./mock.png")}/>

<Appear>
<pre>users/[id]/</pre>
<pre>users/[id]/posts/</pre>
<pre>posts/[id]/</pre>
<pre>users/[id]/</pre>
<pre>users/[id]/</pre>
<pre>users/[id]/</pre>
</Appear>

```notes
- no overfetching / underfetching
- overfetching: downloading unnecessary data
- underfetching: not getting enough data, need to make subsequent requests
- depending on the backend api, data loader or a specific db query will batch all user requests
```
---
export default Split

<Img src={require("file-loader!./mock.png")}/>

```graphql
{
  query($id: Number) {
    users(id: $id) {
      friendsCount
      likes
      commentsCount
      photo
      posts {
        content
        likes {
          users {
            name
            friendsCount
          }
        }
      }
    } 
  }
}
```

## How does it work

---

### Core elements

- schema
  - the 'contract'
  - defined by SDL
  - strict types
- resolver functions 
  - each defined type needs a corresponding resolver function
---
### Simple exapmle
---
export default Split

```graphql
# schema

type Person {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  hairColor: String
  shoeSize: Int
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  title: String!
  author: Person!
  version: Float
  location: String
  likes: [Like]!
}

type Like {
  date: string
  by: Person!
}
```

```graphql
# query

query {
  getPerson(personId: 99) {
    name
    age
    posts {
      title
      author
      likes{
        by {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// resolver

async function getPerson(parent, args, context) {

  const person = await context.model.getPerson(args.personId);
  const posts = await contexe.model.getPostsById(person.postIds)
    .map(post => getLikesFromPost);  
  
  return {
    name,
    age,
    shoeSize,
    hairColor,
    posts,
  };
}
```

### Some buzzwords

<ul>
<Appear>
<li>query, mutation, subscription</li>
<li>schema stitching</li>
<li>data loader</li>
<li>query fragments</li>
<li>schema introspection</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- query, mut., sub. 
  - root types
  - define entry point
  - query is mandatory, mutation is not
  - parallel to get, post-put-patch-delete
  - sub opens a live channel

- stitching
  - include a remote schema and use it as your own
  - f.ex provide contentful or any other CMS (composing)
- loader
  - depending on implementation and resource type, batch requests
- fragments
  - named part of query that repeats
- introspection
  - https://graphql.github.io/swapi-graphql

- authorization
  - gql just a spec
  - http server underneeth
  - possible (and tempting) to do in resolvers
  - better in middleware, or resource
  - concept of resource: api or db handler
```
